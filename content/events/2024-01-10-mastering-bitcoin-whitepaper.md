Our meetups are not just about discussing the book; they're about building a community of Bitcoin enthusiasts and builders.

Discover, discuss, and delve into the world of Bitcoin with us. Your journey towards mastering Bitcoin starts here!

## How It Works

On your own time, read this week's chapter. Show up at this event (in-person or remotely) to discuss the chapter with other participants. Each session will follow this format:

1. Introductions: participants are invited to introduce themselves (we will skip this if there is nobody new in the room).
2. Queries: then, we will go around the room to quickly discern what questions people had, what people were confused about, etc. and take note of these on the whiteboard so we can discuss further.
3. Discussion: next, we will try and collectively answer the study questions together, as well as address any issues people defined in the prior step.
4. Chill: afterwards, those joining in-person typically go to a restaurant or bar together to socialize.

## This Session

In order to give people time to obtain a copy of the book, we are going to first start with the <a href="https://spiral.xyz/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">Bitcoin Whitepaper</a>, which can be found as an appendix in the book, but also freely available on the internet. <a href="https://spiral.xyz/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">Read it here</a>.

### Study Questions

These questions are provided to help guide your thinking as read the material. We'll try to answer these together when we meet to discuss the chapter.

1. What problem does Bitcoin aim to solve in the context of electronic cash systems, and how does it propose to solve it?
2. Explain the concept of a peer-to-peer network in the context of Bitcoin and its significance in ensuring the security and functionality of the system.
3. Discuss the role of digital signatures in Bitcoin transactions. How do they contribute to the integrity and security of the system?
4. What is double-spending in the context of digital currencies, and how does Bitcoin address this issue?
5. Describe the proof-of-work system used in Bitcoin. How does it contribute to the security and trust of the blockchain?
6. How does Bitcoin ensure the validity of transactions and prevent fraudulent activities without relying on a central authority?
7. Discuss the incentives for participants in the Bitcoin network. How do these incentives ensure the longevity and stability of the system?

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I have to buy the book?

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Programming-Open-Blockchain/dp/1098150090?crid=3FFD1FN2H7TZF&keywords=mastering+bitcoin+3rd+edition&qid=1703963363&sprefix=mastering+bitcoin,aps,153&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do:amzn1.fos.006c50ae-5d4c-4777-9bc0-4513d670b6bc" target="_blank">You can buy the book here</a>, and we recommend buying it if you plan to keep up with the reading. However, it's up to you how you do the reading. There is an older version of the book you can read for free on GitHub, but it is many years outdated compared to the 3rd Edition we'll be discussing.

When buying, ensure that you are getting the **3rd Edition** and that <a href="https://twitter.com/hrdng" target="_blank">**David Harding**</a> is listed as one of the authors.

### Can I join remotely?

Yes, <a href="https://atlantabitdevs.org/telegram/" target="_blank">join our Telegram room</a> to be a part of the Atlanta BitDevs community chat. Here, we'll share a Jitsi link before the event where you can join the discussion.

### Can I join if I haven't read this week's chapter?

Even if you haven't kept up with the reading, feel free to join us! While our discussions will center around the week's selected chapters, there's always room for everyone. And don't miss the chance to continue the conversation over dinner, where any and all Bitcoin-related questions are welcome.
