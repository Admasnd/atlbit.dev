Inspired by other BitDevs meetups around the US, our Socratic Seminar events
are formatted to foster debate, information sharing and lively discussion.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Lightning

#### üè∫ Zeus &amp; Mutiny

Zeus wallet launched a new beta version that contains an embedded node, multi-LSP support, simple taproot channels, and a self-custodial lightning address.

[The ZEUS v0.8.0 open beta is here](https://blog.zeusln.com/zeus-v0-8-0-open-beta/)

The self-custodial lightning address is an implementation of an idea called Zaplocker.

This <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1716848494554595526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">received some criticism</a> for relying on HODL invoices, which can tie up liquidity along an entire route for a long time until the payment is finally settled.

As an example, there were issues where Mutiny Wallet users experienced channel force closures when trying to pay to the Zeus lightning addresses. This issue was further compounded when some users did not receive the funds back to their on-chain wallet after the force closure, due to a bug with the wallet broadcasting incorrect state and the LSP sewwping the funds. Keep in mind that this discussion involves a lot of different viewpoints and back-and-point viewpoints.
