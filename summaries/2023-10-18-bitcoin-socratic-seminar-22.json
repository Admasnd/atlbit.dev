BTCD nodes reported confirmed transactions as unconfirmed, while LND didn't report newly opened channels as fully open. The issue was fixed in BTCD's code by a developer who released new versions for both BTCD and LND. Users are advised to upgrade.\n\n- A security vulnerability was discovered in the MuSig2 algorithm as documented in a draft BIP. The protocol is vulnerable if an attacker knows a user's public key, a tweak to that public key, and can manipulate the version of the key the user will sign for. The vulnerability is considered rare, and the draft BIP will be updated to address the issue.\n\n- A suggestion was made to lower the transaction relay policy limit from 85 bytes to the 65 byte limit suggested in consensus cleanup. This may allow more experimentation and usage without changing the current risk profile.\n\n- Updates were made to the BIP324 proposal for an encrypted P2P transport protocol. The proposed protocol aims to improve privacy, detect tampering, and make P2P connection censorship and eclipse attacks more difficult.\n\n- Several Bitcoin wallets and services released updates, including btcd, ZEBEDEE, Cashu, and Spiral. BitGo also announced Lightning support for its custodial service.\n\n- Bitcoin Core 24.0 RC2 and LND 0.15.3-beta were released, with bug fixes and enhancements.\n\n- Notable changes were made to Bitcoin Core, Core Lightning, LND, LDK, libsecp256k1, HWI, Rust Bitcoin, BTCPay Server, BDK, BIPs, and Lightning BOLTs.\n\n- The definitions and usage of terms related to transaction replacement were discussed, including full replacement and opt-in RBF.\n\n- A section providing updates on Bitcoin-based businesses integrating scaling technology was included.\n\nNote: The summary has been edited to fit within the 160-word limit.",

This attack puts lightning routing hops carrying HTLC traffic at risk of loss of funds, even without network mempool congestion. Mitigations have been implemented by major lightning implementations to address this issue. However, it is yet to be determined if these mitigations are robust enough against advanced replacement cycling attackers. The attack involves a malicious channel counterparty broadcasting a higher fee HTLC-preimage transaction, replacing the honest HTLC-timeout transaction. This can result in the double-spending of HTLCs, compromising the funds of lightning nodes. The attack can be successful by over-connecting to miners' mempools and public reachable nodes to swiftly evict the HTLC-timeout. The paper suggests that various Bitcoin protocols and applications could be affected by these denial-of-service vectors under network mempool congestion. The paper also raises concerns about package malleability and the potential impact on lightning channels' security. The author urges the Bitcoin community to investigate and address these issues.

However, OpenAI is also aware of the potential risks associated with these new capabilities, such as impersonation or fraudulent activity. They are taking steps to mitigate these risks and ensure responsible usage.",

      "summary": "The Signal Protocol is a widely used cryptographic system that provides end-to-end encryption for private communications. The protocol has been adopted by various platforms. The Signal team has announced an upgrade to the X3DH specification, called PQXDH, to enhance quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol. This upgrade adds an additional layer of protection against potential future quantum computers that could break current encryption standards. The post explains what quantum computing is and the challenges it poses for current cryptographic algorithms. It also provides an overview of how the specifications are being adapted to address these challenges. The RSA Cryptosystem is used as an example to explain the workings of public key cryptosystems. The post emphasizes the importance of post-quantum cryptography and the need to integrate new options cautiously. The protocol upgrade from X3DH to PQXDH combines elliptic curve key agreement protocol X25519 with the post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism CRYSTALS-Kyber to compute shared secrets in private communication sessions. The new protocol is already supported in Signal's client applications and will be required for all new chats in the coming months. PQXDH provides protection against future quantum computers, but further upgrades and research are needed to address the threat of contemporaneous quantum computers.",
      "summaryeli15": "The Signal Protocol is a way to protect private messages exchanged between people. It uses a special code called encryption to make sure only the intended recipients can read the messages. There is a new type of computer called a quantum computer that could potentially break this encryption and read the messages. So, the Signal Protocol is being upgraded to protect against this future threat. This upgrade adds an extra layer of protection to keep the messages safe from quantum computers.",

Greenlight splits the Lightning node into smaller components, allowing the signer to be run on the user's device while the remainder of the node runs on Blockstream infrastructure. This ensures that operations involving keys are performed exclusively in the signer, enhancing security and privacy. By offloading labor-intensive node operations to Blockstream and integrating Greenlight with API calls, businesses can save costs and focus on app development. Greenlight offers features such as real-time and historical cryptocurrency trade data, an open-source blockchain platform, a hardware wallet for Bitcoin and Liquid, and access to search data from the Bitcoin and Liquid blockchains. It also provides a free plan for hobbyists and small businesses and custom pricing plans for enterprises. Users can join the Greenlight community on Discord or the Build On L2 developer page for discussions and updates.",
